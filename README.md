# NB Graph
Uses a php proxy to retreive search results from the Nasjonalbiblioteket API and turn them into a json object which in turn can be put through charts.js to make graphs.

A working demo can be found [here](http://jekyll-hyde.no/nbgraph).

More features coming soon!

-   Refined search controls (mediatype etc.)
-   Raw data, comma and tab spaced data, datasets
-   Integration with [NB Search](http://jekyll-hyde/nbsearch)
